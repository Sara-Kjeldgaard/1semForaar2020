# Errors

Here is a html document with several errors. Use the developer tools (e.g. in Chrome). Find the errors and correct them.

The performance sucks too.

So remove the errors, and optimize the performance.

Tools:

* Chrome web developer tools.
* Probably you'll need something like GIMP or Photoshop
